You define an interface (a set of methods) that different classes can implement in their own ways. This makes the code easier to understand because you're dealing with high-level concepts rather than getting bogged down in the intricacies of each implementation.\n","\n","Conciseness and Clarity: By using a common interface, you can avoid code duplication. Instead of writing the same logic for different object types, you write it once for the interface and let the subclasses handle the specifics. This leads to shorter, more concise code that's easier to follow and maintain.\n","Enhanced Reusability:\n","Generic Code: Polymorphic code is often more generic, meaning it can work with various objects as long as they implement the required interface. This allows you to write code that can be reused in different contexts without modification. For example, a function that calculates the area of a shape can work with squares, circles, rectangles, etc., as long as they all have a method to calculate their area.\n","Extensibility: Polymorphism makes your code more extensible. You can easily add new classes that implement the interface without having to change the existing code.
